# DanKlco.com

My personal website, built with [Sling CMS](https://github.com/apache/sling-org-apache-sling-app-cms).

## Build

Build the project run:

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallBundle
    
This will build and install the bundle into a local Sling CMS instance running at `http://localhost:8080`
